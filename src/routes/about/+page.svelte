    <!-- Always wrap large text. -->
    <p>
        The UWindsor Board Games Club is an organization formed to offer students the opportunity to expand their
        strategic knowledge and critical thinking skills by providing a safe and fun environment away from the stresses
        of academia for all game lovers whether it be board games, card games, or anything the mind can imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our aim is to make board gaming an accessible and enjoyable fun experience for everyone. To become the most
        reliable place for organizing quality modern board gaming events, by being an accessible global meeting place
        anybody can use, designed to meet the specific needs of the board game community in a user friendly and
        convenient way.
    </p>
    <p>
        We play for fun and for education! We aim to teach, promote and make available games to build community within
        the club. We are dedicated to fair fun, inclusivity and good sportsmanship both in-game and in our interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        As such, we encourage people of all levels of familiarity and skill to participate in our events. We aim to
        provide an environment that allows people to experience all types of games, emphasizing fun over competition.
        Everyone is welcome to become a member, so invite your friends and come play some games!
