    <h1>What is Dungeons & Dragons?</h1>

    <p>
        Dungeons & Dragons is the world's most beloved tabletop roleplaying game allowing players to go on adventures in
        lands imagined by a Dungeon Master. It is separate from our usual in person and online gatherings because it
        requires a lot of preparation and commitment.

        <i> "D&D is a game that focuses on storytelling. The dice just help you along. Everything is your
        decision, from what you look like, to how you act, to what happens next. The collective creativity in your D&D
        game builds stories that you'll tell again and again—ranging from the stuff of legend to absurd incidents
        that'll make you laugh years later. Have fun and remember the golden rule—never split the party!" </i>
        the Coast, creator of D&D.

            The Bandy Bunch must thwart the Velsakath in order to stop a mass genocide. 
            Will they ever be able to find this underground race? Can they stop the people
