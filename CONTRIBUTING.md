# How to contribute?

First make a fork of the project, then install it, if you are going to git clone it then you should run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/suite.git
```

It is important you make sure you put your username on it and not UWBGC or else you will install the main version and
not your fork.

After installing, go back to [Setup in README.md](README.md#setup) to set up your fork. Once you have both the website
and bot running correctly go to the next step.
